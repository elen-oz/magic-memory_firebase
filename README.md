# Magic Memory

The Memory board game is a world-famous memory game.

## Rules of the game

There are 12 shuffled cards on the playing field, arranged with the picture face down. The player opens two cards and if the cards opened make a pair, they continue to open cards until they have opened two different ones. The game ends when all pairs of cards have been opened. At the bottom of the field there is a counter with a count of the total number of pairs opened.
